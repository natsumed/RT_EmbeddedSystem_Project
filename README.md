# RT_EmbeddedSystem_Project
This project will provide you with a code that shows the value of duty cycle of BeagleBone Black as well as the pwm signal and blinks a LED using the GPIO. Most importantly, this project uses the sqlite3 to create a database to stock the values of the ADC in a table called ADC_Table
